# Leetcode Solutions

Solution scripts to Leetcode problems that I solved. 

If the script is marked as `*_incomplete` then it is not solved yet, but I have been working on it.

There are helped scripts `complete.sh` and `create.sh`

* `complete.sh` : ```complete.sh 1337_incomplete.cpp``` will rename 1337_incomplete.cpp to 1337.cpp. Easier to mark files as completed.

* `create.sh`: ```create.sh 1337``` will create a file 1337_incomplete.cpp.
